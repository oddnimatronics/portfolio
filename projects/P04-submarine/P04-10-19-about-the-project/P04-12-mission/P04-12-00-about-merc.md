**M.E.R.C**, or *Mechanical Engineering Robot Contest*, is a robotics program hosted by [C.A.T](https://www.facebook.com/CreAcaTechnoCLub) - an academic club of [HCMUT](https://hcmut.edu.vn/tong-quan?lang=en)'s mechanical engineering department, composed of competitors from different universities in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The event encourages STEM learning and cooperation by hosting competitions between robots in a yearly changed game.

In a typical game, two teams are labeled as different colors and they compete against each other for points. The team that has the most points wins the match.

### M.E.R.C 2023 theme - *Castle Warfare* <sup><a href="#yes">[1]</a></sup>
*M.E.R.C 2023* simulates a border area between two territories, where there are many resources and extremely important strategic locations.

Entering the competition, the teams will role-play and engage in a comprehensive "battle". To win, the team will have to use all the smart tactics along with combat flexibility to advance to occupy the opponent's base, and set up obstacles and defenses to protect home territory. Talent, creativity and bravery will be the key factor to help players overcome the challenges and become the ultimate champion.

"*Castle Warfare*" promotes the spirit of non-stop emulation and creativity in learning and research of HCMUT students throughout 66 years of history. Accordingly, it is the desire through M.E.R.C to raise national pride, the spirit of territorial defense and fight hard to defend the country.
