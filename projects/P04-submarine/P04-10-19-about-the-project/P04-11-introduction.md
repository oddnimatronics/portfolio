*Submarine* is a hybrid 4WD, Bluetooth-controlled competitive robot car. It is capable of collecting and holding solid game pieces of varying profile while moving across the playing field with desired accuracy and excessively high speed.

Overall frame is constructed with [T-slotted 2020 aluminum framing rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-slot_structural_framing) and compatible profile mounting accessories, features a very unique continuous belt routing elevator using **1:1 gear power transmission technique**.

The robot has two Arduino micro-controller boards, one for propulsion control and one for end effector state switching. Each communicates directly with a separate Android device via a paired Bluetooth module connected to its integrated pins. The boards are programmable using the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

Our hybrid wheel setup consists of two regular 65mm tractor wheels as *drive wheels* and two self-manufactured 65mm [omni wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omni_wheel#:~:text=Omni%20wheels%20or%20poly%20wheels,slide%20laterally%20with%20great%20ease.) as *steering wheels*, which mimics **front axle steering mechanism** and allows for smooth turns while maintaining friction.

Our robot was constructed in a 7-week period regarding [M.E.R.C 2023](/projects/P04-submarine/P04-10-19-about-the-project/P04-12-mission.md) tournament. In the end we were eliminated from the competition in the quarterfinals, but we gained a lot of new experiences, insights, and connections, and this was honestly an invaluable experience.
