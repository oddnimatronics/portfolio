We participated in [M.E.R.C 2023](/projects/P04-submarine/P04-10-19-about-the-project/P04-12-mission.md) tournament, and each one of us was a beneficial element in making the final robot.

Since this is the first time working together, we did have a few hiccups, from miscommunication, to having been compelled to constantly work overnight, but at the end, we are glad that we grew together as a team through this enlightening experience.
