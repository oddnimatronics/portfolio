> "Submarine - we are unshrinking."

These words were the culmination of several weeks of hard work and effort leading up to our battles against competitive, experienced and potentious competitors.

### Preliminary round
We finished in 6th place and earned the right to choose our opponents in the next round.\

### Knock-out round
We did not record our play.

Unfortunately, the Quarterfinals marked the end of our team's journey **due to a low battery in the very last three seconds**. :sob: 

Yet despite the setbacks, we were able to come back home stronger, more courageous, and more innovative than before.
