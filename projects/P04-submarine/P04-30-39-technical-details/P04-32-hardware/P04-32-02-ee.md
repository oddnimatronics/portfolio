The gripper is a critical component of the robot car's ability to compete in games. It enables the robot car to pick up and move game pieces, which is the primary method of scoring points.\
Our gripper is controlled by a separated controller board.

### How it moves
Our member, [highzer0](https://github.com/highzer0), has been experiencing on his gripper mechanism before using rack and pinion mechanism as the base.

The rack and pinion mechanism is a type of linear actuator that converts rotational motion into linear motion. It is used in the robot's gripper to open and close the two fingers horizontally.

The squishies are made of a soft material that will not damage the game pieces.
