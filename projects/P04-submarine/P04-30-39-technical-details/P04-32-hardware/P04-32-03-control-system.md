### Chassis-mounted circuit
![](/projects/P04-submarine/media/toggle-switch-lmao.jpg)
This is the heart of the robot. It is responsible for controlling all of the robot's components, including the drive motors, the lift system, and the signal communication.

The controller for the chassis mounted circuit is an Arduino Mega 2560. 

The drive motors for the chassis mounted circuit are four gearbox motors with encoders, controlled by two H bridge modules, L298N.

The lift system for the chassis mounted circuit is controlled by a Nema 42 stepper motor that can hold 1kg and a TB6600 stepper motor driver. 

Signal communication is handled by an HC-06 module, allows the Arduino Mega 2560 to communicate with remote control application on Android phone.
