### Acknowledged issues
- *Light theme* interface is not yet synchronized with the *Dark theme*. If *Light theme* is your default, please **<span class="nes-text is-error">locate the moon toggle switch in the top right corner to enable dark mode</span>**.
- The color of headings will not change to white upon initial load (they will appear in pink). Though this does not interfere with other functionalities, it is highly recommended to **<span class="nes-text is-error">reload the site once</span>** to ensure that the custom CSS script is fully loaded before continuing.
